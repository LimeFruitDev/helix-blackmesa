This codebase is a bit different than the one we used in the last iteration of BMRP.
We had to strip some code that the original developers of are no longer affiliated with LimeFruit and we couldn't reach them for permission.
Additionally, some code is specific to our backend services or contains sensitive data and as such has been removed or modified.
This contains a list of changes.
